This comes from an NPR Morning Edition Sunday puzzle by Will Shortz.

Take the word EASY: Its first three letters — E, A and S — are the fifth,
first, and nineteenth letters, respectively, in the alphabet. If you add
5 + 1 + 19, you get 25, which is the value of the alphabetical position of
Y, the last letter of EASY.

Can you think of a common five-letter word that works in the opposite way —
in which the value of the alphabetical positions of its last four letters add
up to the value of the alphabetical position of its first letter?
